# OpenAI Agents Project

A sophisticated implementation leveraging the OpenAI Agents SDK to build powerful multi-agent workflows and autonomous systems.

## üöÄ Overview

This project utilizes the OpenAI Agents SDK, a lightweight yet powerful framework for creating and managing AI agents. Our implementation focuses on building scalable and efficient multi-agent systems that can handle complex tasks through coordinated agent interactions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Intelligent Agents**: Custom-configured LLMs with specific instructions and capabilities
- **Seamless Handoffs**: Coordinated task transfers between specialized agents
- **Built-in Safety**: Implemented guardrails for input/output validation
- **Advanced Tracing**: Comprehensive tracking system for debugging and optimization
- **Custom Tools**: Extended functionality through specialized agent tools
